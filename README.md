# Image Edge Detection Project


## Overview

This project is a simple edge detection tool built using OpenCV and C#. It processes an input image, applies edge detection using user-defined thresholds, and saves the processed image to an output directory.

## Features

- Reads an input image from a predefined folder.
- Uses OpenCV's `Canny` method for edge detection.
- Allows customization of thresholds for edge detection.
- Outputs the processed image with a user-defined name.
- Logs the process for debugging and tracking.
